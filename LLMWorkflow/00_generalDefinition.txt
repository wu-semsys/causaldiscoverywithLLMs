Let’s define a concise “meta-language” for clarity. Whenever the following terms are used, they carry the meanings below:
Platform
A Platform is any device, facility, or logical group that can host sensors measuring data.
Devices, facilities, and logical groupings are all considered Platforms in the SENSE stack.
Platform Type
A type of Platform. Each Platform has a Platform Type.
Sensor
A Sensor measures some property in the system and is always hosted by a Platform.
Each sensor is physically or logically located on exactly one Platform.
hostedBy
A hierarchical relationship indicating that a sub-platform (or a sensor) is hosted by a higher-level Platform.
The first (top-level) Platform is typically considered the “host,” and any nested Platforms or Sensors are said to be hostedBy it.
State Type Causality
A causal link between two State Types. Each causal relation has three key features describing how and why one State Type influences another:
- Topological Relation: Describes where (topologically) the cause State Type occurs in relation to the effect State Type.
    - samePlatform: cause and effect happen on the same Platform
    - parentPlatform: the Platform of the effect State hosts the Platform of the cause State
    - siblingPlatform: the States occur on two distinct Platforms hosted by the same parent
- Temporal Relation: Describes when the cause State Type occurs relative to the effect State Type.
    - before: cause State starts and ends before effect State starts
    - overlaps: cause State starts before the effect State and ends after the effect State has started
    - contains: cause State starts before and ends after the effect State has ended
    - identity: cause and effect States start and end at the same time
- Causal Relation: Describes the nature of the causal connection.
    - cause: If the cause State occurs, the effect State most probably occurs as a result
    - enable: If the cause State does not occur, the effect State most probably does not occur
    - prevent: If the cause State occurs, the effect State most probably does not occur as a result
