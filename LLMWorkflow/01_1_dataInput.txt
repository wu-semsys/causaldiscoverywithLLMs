I have tabular data, and I would like it transformed into a descriptive natural language
format where each row is expressed as a sentence. The first row contains headers, and
subsequent rows contain values. The transformation should follow this pattern:
Example Input:
Platform, PlatformType, hostedBy_Platform
PlatformA, TypeX, PlatformB

Sensor, hostedBy_Platform, observes_ObservableProperty
SensorA, PlatformA, ObservablePropertyA

Example Result:
• ItemA is a type of TypeX.

If a cell is blank or missing, describe it appropriately. For example:
“ItemX does not have a type.”
Use your general knowledge and reasoning capabilities to decide the relation between the
columns. It does not necessarily have to be “is a type of,” but could also reflect a totally
different relation depending on the context of the data.
Now transform the following table into the same format:
